# How to Use Diablo 2 Single Player Item Pack 1.13
 
Diablo 2 Single Player Item Pack 1.13 is a collection of item files that can be used with a save editor to test out different builds and gear combinations in Diablo 2. The item pack contains all set and unique items, as well as all ladder-only and 1.11 runewords, and some rare and crafted items. The item pack is based on the original "Kingpint'z Item Pack" that was created for open battle.net dueling, but has been reuploaded and updated by jordanbrauer on GitHub.

In this article, we will show you how to use the item pack with Hero Editor, a popular save editor for Diablo 2. You will need to download both the item pack and Hero Editor from their respective links below:
 
- [Diablo 2 Single Player Item Pack 1.13](https://github.com/jordanbrauer/diablo2-single-player-item-pack)
- [Hero Editor 0.96](https://www.ladderhall.com/download.php?file=Hero_Editor_V0.96.zip)

Once you have downloaded and extracted both files, follow these steps to use the item pack:

1. Start Hero Editor and load your character (or click on Extras and look left, to create a new character).
2. Click on Inventory. Now right-click on the inventory grid.
3. Click on Load Item. Now browse for the item you want from the item pack folder.
4. Click on Save. Now the character you selected has got the item.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for any other items you want to add or remove.

That's it! You can now enjoy testing out different gear combinations and builds in Diablo 2 single player mode. Have fun!
  
Using the item pack has many benefits for Diablo 2 players who want to experiment with different aspects of the game. Some of the benefits are:

- You can test out any build you want without having to farm or trade for the items. This can save you a lot of time and frustration, especially if you want to try out niche or unconventional builds.
- You can compare different items and runewords and see how they affect your character's stats and performance. This can help you optimize your gear choices and plan ahead for future upgrades.
- You can explore new content and features that are added or changed in Diablo 2 patches or mods. For example, you can use the item pack to access new runewords that were introduced in version 2.4, or to play with classic LoD item sprites that were upscaled for Diablo 2: Resurrected.
- You can have fun with creating your own custom items or modifying existing ones. You can use Hero Editor to change the attributes, sockets, colors, names, and graphics of any item in the pack. You can also create your own "what if" scenarios, such as using ethereal set items or making Tyrael's Might have -100% requirements.

Using the item pack does not affect your online gameplay or your original single player characters. You can use the item pack with PlugY, a mod that enables infinite stash space and shared stash among characters. You can also use the item pack with Project Diablo 2, a popular mod that aims to improve and balance Diablo 2 while staying true to its core gameplay.
 
However, using the item pack may also have some drawbacks or limitations. Some of them are:

- You may lose some of the challenge and satisfaction of finding or earning your own items in the game. Using the item pack may make the game too easy or boring for some players who enjoy the grind and the RNG.
- You may encounter some bugs or errors with some items or runewords that are not compatible with certain versions or mods of Diablo 2. You may also have some issues with importing or exporting items with Hero Editor if you are not familiar with how it works.
- You may not be able to use the item pack with some other mods or tools that modify or replace the item files or databases of Diablo 2. You may also have some conflicts or compatibility issues with different versions of PlugY or Project Diablo 2.

Therefore, you should always backup your original files and characters before using the item pack, and use it at your own risk. You should also respect the rules and etiquette of online play and not use the item pack to cheat or grief other players.
